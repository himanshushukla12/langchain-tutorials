    "# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\n",
    "over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A\n",
    "architecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see\n",
    "how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.\n",
    "LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in\n",
    "complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\n",
    "this [high-level overview of different retrieval techinques](/docs/concepts/#retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has a number of components designed to help build Q&A applications, and RAG applications more generally. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing [question/answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. This is done with [Document Loaders](/docs/concepts/#document-loaders).\n",
    "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/#text-splitters) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/concepts/#vector-stores) and [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/#embedding-models) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval and generation\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/#retrievers).\n",
    "5. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/concepts/#chat-models) / [LLM](/docs/concepts/#llms) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires these langchain dependencies:\n",

Next, perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns. Finally, use a time series forecasting model to predict Q2 trends.\\n\\nModel Selection: For this task, I would assign a machine learning model suited for time series forecasting, such as ARIMA or Prophet, based on the data characteristics.\\n\\nTask Execution: After processing the Q1 sales data (file path: /path/to/q1_sales_data.csv), I found seasonality and overall upward trend. Using the selected ARIMA model (parameters optimized through grid search), the predictions for Q2 sales indicate a continued growth pattern. The complete file path where the predictions are saved is /path/to/q2_predictions.csv.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:How does the Tree of Thoughts approach enhance problem-solving according to Yao et al. 2023?\\n\\nAnswer:The Tree of Thoughts method enhances problem-solving by breaking down complex problems into simpler thought steps, generating multiple possible solutions at each stage, and structuring these ideas into a tree format. This allows for either breadth-first or depth-first search processes to evaluate each state, potentially with assistance from a classifier or majority voting system.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:In the task execution phase mentioned by Yao et al. 2023, what role do expert models play and how are their outcomes documented?\\n\\nAnswer:Expert models are responsible for executing the designated tasks during the task execution phase. They carry out operations specific to the task at hand and then document their results. These outputs are usually logged for future reference or further analysis. The documentation could be in various forms depending on the nature of the task and the requirements of the system being used.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:Could you elaborate on the different methods of task decomposition outlined by Yao et al. 2023 and provide examples for each?\\n\\nAnswer:Certainly! Task decomposition can be achieved through three main methods:\\n\\n1. Direct Instruction to Large Language Models (LLM): Here, simple prompts guide the LLM to decompose the task.

In the context of artificial intelligence systems, like the hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT), this methodology allows for efficient processing and resolution of intricate problems. By identifying the key components and their interrelationships through advanced algorithms like LSTM networks, the system can dissect the overall issue, tackle each subtask individually, and ultimately achieve a comprehensive solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of HGAT, during the task planning stage, the LSTM network examines the user's query. It analyzes the text, identifies essential elements, and understands their connections. For instance, if the user asks, \"How does photosynthesis work?\" the LSTM might break this down into subtasks like \"what are the raw materials for photosynthesis?\", \"what process converts these materials into glucose?\", etc. Each subtask is then addressed sequentially, ensuring a thorough understanding and accurate response to the original query.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach not only simplifies complex problems but also enhances the efficiency and accuracy of AI systems. By focusing on individual subtasks, these systems can leverage their specific strengths for each part, resulting in a more effective and reliable problem-solving process.<|endoftext|>"

    "First: each of these components (`retriever`, `prompt`, `llm`, etc.) are instances of [Runnable](/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language-lcel). This means that they implement the same methods-- such as sync and async `.invoke`, `.stream`, or `.batch`-- which makes them easier to connect together. They can be connected into a [RunnableSequence](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableSequence.html)-- another Runnable-- via the `|` operator.\n",

Here, `format_docs` is cast to a [RunnableLambda](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html), and the dict with `\"context\"` and `\"question\"` is cast to a [RunnableParallel](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableParallel.html). The details are less important than the bigger point, which is that each object is a Runnable.\n",

This process forms a hierarchical structure similar to a tree, wherein each node represents a distinct thought or action required to progress towards the ultimate goal.\\n\\nThis decomposition can occur through various means:\\n\\n1. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) via simple prompting techniques such as \"Outline the steps required to accomplish XYZ,\" which instructs the model to generate a structured breakdown of the task.\\n\\n2. Utilizing task-specific directives, for instance, \"Devise a plot structure for a novel,\" which guides the LLM to decompose the task of narrative creation into identifiable components such as character development, setting establishment, conflict generation, etc.\\n\\n3. Through human intervention, wherein individuals manually divide complex tasks into simpler ones, providing a nuanced perspective that may not be readily inferred by automated systems.\\n\\nFollowing task decomposition, the ensuing phase involves the strategic allocation of these tasks to domain experts, referred to as \\'expert models\\'. Each expert model embodies proficiency in a specific area relevant to its designated task. For example, one model might excel in data analysis, another in creative writing, and so forth.\\n\\nThe execution of these tasks follows a systematic approach. Each expert model undertakes its assigned task, processes the necessary input, and records the resulting output. These outputs could range from numerical analyses, written content, processed images, among others, depending upon the nature of the task assigned.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition serves as a crucial initial step in the Tree of Thoughts methodology.
