# Project Title: Langchain RAG with Hugging Face
## Who can refer to this project:
- Anyone who is interested in building and learning fundamentals of a RAG application using Langchain and Hugging Face.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Langchain and Hugging Face. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a Q&A system that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and additional data sources to answer questions effectively.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Indexing:** Learn how to load and index data using Langchain's document loaders and vector stores.
- **Text Splitting:** Understand the process of splitting large documents into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval.
- **Embedding and Storage:** Discover how to embed text data and store it in a vector database for quick access.
- **Retrieval and Generation:** Implement a retrieval system that fetches relevant data and generates answers using a language model.
- **LangSmith Integration:** Utilize LangSmith for tracing and understanding the application flow.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: `langchain`, `langchain-community`, `langchain-chroma`, `diffusers`, `gradio`, `colorama`, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com:himanshushukla12/langchain-tutorials.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `rag-huggingface.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up and run the RAG application.
3. Enter your prompts and observe the generated responses.

## Example

Provide a brief example of how to use the notebook, including sample input and expected output.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues:** Ensure your API keys and environment variables are correctly set.
- **Dependency Errors:** Verify that all required packages are installed and up-to-date.
