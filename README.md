## Introduction

LangChain simplifies the process of building applications that require **natural language understanding**, **text generation**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. By integrating with language models, LangChain provides efficient tools for managing chains of prompts, embeddings, and external knowledge sources to create more powerful applications.

This repository contains tutorials that cover a wide range of topics, from basic usage of LangChain components to advanced techniques for retrieval-based question answering (QA) and building complex language model applications.

## Getting Started

If you're new to LangChain, the best place to start is by following the introductory tutorials in this repository. You'll learn how to:
- Set up LangChain in your environment
- Work with chains of prompts
- Implement document retrieval and embeddings
- Integrate with external knowledge sources for enhanced question answering

## Tutorials

Hereâ€™s a list of the tutorials provided in this repository:

1. **langchain-HF-local-RAG**  
   - A step-by-step guide to creating a system that combines language models with external knowledge retrieval.
   - Learn how to generate and use embeddings to improve retrieval and document similarity.
2. **langchain-chat-vector-bd**
    - Explained about working on context based chst

2. **Contextual Retrieval with LangChain** (upcoming) 
   Implement advanced retrieval techniques such as overlapping chunks and top-K filtering using cosine similarity.

3. **Fine-Tuning LangChain for Custom Use Cases**  (upcoming)
   A more advanced tutorial on customizing LangChain components for domain-specific applications.

Each tutorial contains code examples, explanations, and use cases that you can adapt to your own projects.
